# Adaptive Inspection Experimental Toolset


## Introduction

This repository is used to store and document the progress of developing a tool set for investigating and illustrating *adaptive-inspection*, a research project undertaken by the SPARE Research Group at the University of Limerick, Ireland. Funded by the CONFIRM (www.confirm.ie) and Lero (www.lero.ie) Science Foundation Ireland Research centres.

We propose that adaptive-inspection can be used to optimise inspection within dynamic environments the primary use-case of which is to mitigate fraud in smart supply chains.

Therefore this repository contains a toolset which allows:

* Modelling of static and dynamic supply chains models using a topology-based technique
* Simulation of supply chain inspection techniques
* Emprirical evaluation of different topology-based inspection optimisation techniques


## Technologies

* Python3  - core development
* NetworkX - Supplychain modelling and analysis
