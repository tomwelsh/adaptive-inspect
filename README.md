# Adaptive Inspection Experimental Tool set


## Introduction

This repository is used to store and document the progress of developing a tool set for investigating and illustrating *adaptive-inspection*, a research project undertaken by the SPARE@Lero Research Group at the University of Limerick, Ireland.

We propose that adaptive-inspection can be used to solve inspection resource allocation problems within large and dynamic environments to mitigate negative activities such as fraud. The primary motivating target for this approach is smart supply chains.

To achieve this goal, this repository will contain software modules to:

* Generate spatial models of supply chains.
* Generate temporal models of supply chain assets
* Verify combined spatiotemporal supply chain topologies
* Compute the value of inspection against cost, at a particular spatiotemporal location, under dynamically changing environments
* Define optimal inspection zones, to manage available inspection resources within cost constraints


## Technologies

* Python3  - core development
* NetworkX - SC model analysis

## Roadmap
